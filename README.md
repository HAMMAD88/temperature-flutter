# Temperature Control App 🌡️

This repository houses a Flutter project developed as a group assignment for the "Hardware and Devices" course at Swansea University.

## Project Overview 📝

The Temperature Control App is an innovative Flutter application that empowers you to adjust the temperature of a cup remotely. Leveraging the accelerometer in an Android device, you can manipulate the cup's temperature just by rotating your phone. The project's primary components are:

- Remote server connection 🌐
- Phone rotation-based temperature control 🔄
