# Temperature App

A  Flutter project.

# Introduction
This App is the part of a group project done in Swansea Uiversity for the course of Hardware and Devices. I implemented this flutter app that can connect to a remote server and that can used to change the temperature of the cup using the phone rotation by hand (using accelrometer in the android phone).

 This was the cup sever controlled by the android phone.
